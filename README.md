# Note Taker Starter Code

## Description
This project entailed creating a server file with back-end routes that would direct to different html pages. Within those pages, new data that was written into the notes and saved would parse into the db.JSON file as an object of an array. The steps required were:
- getting and posting the routes for the index.html and notes.html
- getting and posting the object data into a "/api/notes" route
- posting the server and code to heroku.
